Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <h3>
      Typography
    </h3>
    <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

    <h4>
      Heading Font: Montserret
    </h4>
    <p>
      Montserret is a sans-serif font with high popularity in the online space. I am using this font for its large range
      of weight options and ability to draw attention.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Paragraph Font: Hind
    </h4>
    <p>
      Hind is a sans-serif font that is a complement to Montserret. I am using it for its looks, specifically that it is
      good at small fonts and clean in appearance.

      What can JMC do for you?
    </p>
    <p>
      You’re witnessing the magic of creation. Pretty cool right? It seems you have a goal to meet, an ambition to make
      a reality. Well, lucky for you, that is what we’re all about. We get our kicks from using magic to make the
      impossible, possible and we love using your imagination to stretch our limits of creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We understand it can be difficult to know where to look to get your goals met and your deadlines beat. We have
      felt that way before too. Everyone says they can do it, but they lack one important thing… the magic of creation.
      Lucky for you that’s our foundation to make great products for the ambitious. Just Magically Creative is a
      multi-disciplinary studio, which means we do it all. We do everything from brand design to complex interactive
      installations. Basically, we are saying we enjoy bending reality as a career and you get to be the crux in our
      endeavors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Types of Work: Installation, Branding & Strategy, Web Development, UI & UX, Concept Design, VR & AR, Animation,
      Illustration, Machine Learning, Creative Direction, and more…
    </p>
    <p>
      We would love to hear from you! It takes more than one to harness the powers of magic after all.

      It seems your interest is peaked. Well, here is a little peak at how we use that magic to change the world. We
      can’t tell you all of the details, because it would ruin a perfectly good secret, but we can let a little slip.

      What to expect from JMC?
    </p>
    <p>
      1. We are in, All the way:
      We are here to help until the job is complete and to keep doing it again and again. We believe that the best only
      comes from constant growth and that can’t happen with a one off. We hope to keep seeing you again and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Magic is Our Guide:
      We believe in being transparent and open with each other. We want you to share your thoughts and feelings, but
      that also means we will tell you when you may be getting off course. Like we said, we like long term collaboration
      and that means we all keep course correcting.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. We are all accountable for our own work:
      We value making things simple for you to understand. We enjoy having those who work on your ambitions interact
      with you directly, pretty cool huh? This is one important step toward magic.

    </p>
    <p>
      4. Flexibility is a requirement for success:
      We all need to be agile and flexible in the world of today. We have learned something that stays stagnant will be
      forgotten. One of our best assets is to be able to adapt as needed.

    </p>
    <p>
      5. We are Constantly Innovating:
      We hope that you will too! Expect for us to push the boundaries of what is accepted to reach your goals. We hope
      you will also look outside those boundaries.

    </p>
    <p>
      6. The world is our canvas:
      It doesn’t matter the heights, depths, or anything in between. We are a United States company with an
      international focus. We welcome all to learn about the magic of creation and to see what it can do for you.

    </p>
    <p>
      7. Passion is a must:
      You will learn quickly that magic flows when those involved are passionate. We certainly are and we expect you are
      too. That means we are already on our way to success.
