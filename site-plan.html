        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Montserret
      </h4>
      <p>
        Montserret is a sans-serif font with high popularity in the online space. I am using this font for its large range of weight options and ability to draw attention.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Hind
      </h4>
      <p>
        Hind is a sans-serif font that is a complement to Montserret. I am using it for its looks, specifically that it is good at small fonts and clean in appearance.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs.  Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and experienced rafters.  No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it happen for you.
