        <h2 class="right_align point_one">1. Magic Requires 100%</h2>

        <p class="right_align point_one">We are here to help until the job is complete and often that is more than the first delivery. 
            We believe that the best only comes from constant growth and that can't happen with a one off. 
            We hope to keep seeing you again and again.</p>

        <h2 class="point_two">2. One Must Let Magic Guide</h2>

        <p class="point_two">We believe in being transparent and open with each other. 
            We want you to share your thoughts, feelings, and ambitions! 
            Transparency also means we will tell you when you are getting off course. 
            Like we said, we like long term collaboration and that means we all keep course correcting.</p>

        <h2 class="point_three">3. We Are All Accountable For Our Own Work</h2>

        <p class="point_three">We value making things simple for you to understand. 
            We enjoy having those who work on your ambitions interact with you directly, pretty cool huh? 
            This is one imporant step toward achieving magic.</p>

        <h2 class="right_align point_four">4. Flexibility is a Requirement for Success</h2>

        <p class="right_align point_four">We all need to be agile and flexible in the market of today. 
            We have learned that if something stays stagnant, it will be forgotten. 
            One of our best assets is adaptation when needed.</p>

        <h2 class="point_five">5. Magic Means One is Constantly Innovating</h2>

        <p class="point_five">We hope that you will too! Expect for us to push the boundries of what is accepted to reach your goals. 
            We hope you will also look outside those boundries.</p>

        <h2 class="point_six">6. The World is Our Canvas</h2>
        
        <p class="point_six">It doesn't matter the heights, depths, or anything in between. 
            We welcome all to learn about the magic of creation and see what it can do for you.</p>

        <h2 class="right_align point_seven">7. Passion is a Must Have</h2>

        <p class="right_align point_seven">You will learn quickly that magic flows when those involved are passionate. 
            We certainly are and we expect you are too. That means we are already on our way to success.</p>
