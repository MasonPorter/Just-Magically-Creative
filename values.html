              <h2>1. Magic Requires 100%</h2>
              <p>We are here to help until the job is complete and often that is more than the first delivery. 
                  We believe that the best only comes from constant growth and that can't happen with a one off. 
                  <span class="yellow_text">We hope to keep seeing you again and again.</span></p>

              <h2>2. One Must Let Magic Guide</h2>
              <p><span class="yellow_text">We believe in being transparent</span> with each other. 
                  We want you to share your thoughts and feelings about our work!
                  This also means we will tell you when we feel you are getting off course. 
                  Like we said, we like long term collaboration and that means we all keep course correcting.</p>

              <p><span class="yellow_text">We value making things simple</span> for you to understand. 
                  We enjoy having those who work on your ambitions interact with you directly, pretty cool huh? 
                  This is one imporant step toward achieving magic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="point_four">
              <h2>4. Flexibility is a Requirement for Success</h2>
              <p>We all need to be agile and flexible in the market of today. 
                  We have learned that if something stays stagnant, it will be forgotten. 
                  <span class="yellow_text">One of our best assets is adaptation</span> when needed.</p>
            </div>

              <h2>5. Magic Means Constant Innovating</h2>
              <p>We hope to also see you do the same! <span class="yellow_text">Expect for us to push the boundries</span> of creativity to reach your goals. 
                  We hope you will also push those boundries as you imagine your end product.</p>

            <div class="point_seven">
            <h2>7. Passion is a Must Have</h2>
            <p>You will learn quickly that <span class="yellow_text">magic flows best when those involved are passionate</span>. 
                We certainly are and we're expecting you are too if you are reading this.
                That means we are already on our way to success.</p>
